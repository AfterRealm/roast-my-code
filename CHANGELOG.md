# Changelog

## v2.1.0 — 2026-04-05

> *86% eval pass rate. 97% excluding the one mode that literally can't run in headless.*

### Eval Results — Iteration 7
- 9 test cases, 82 assertions, Opus reviewer + Opus judge
- **86% overall pass rate** (97% excluding Panel Roast timeout)
- 7/9 tests at **100%**: security-nightmare, spaghetti-monster, skill-roast, diff-roast, batter-battle, auto-fix, and decent-code at 88%
- Snoop Dogg personality: **88%** — consistent voice throughout, accurate findings
- Auto-Fix offer: **100%** — correct format, correct placement
- Panel Roast: 0% — known limitation (can't spawn subagents in `claude -p` headless mode)
- All quality metrics 4.4-4.6/5 (accuracy, humor, actionability, format compliance)

### Eval Framework Fixes
- All test prompts now explicitly specify mode (e.g., "Standard roast this") to skip interactive mode picker in headless eval
- Fixed eval report template to show correct test case count
- Iteration 6 (pre-fix) and Iteration 7 (post-fix) results included

## v2.0.0 — 2026-04-05

> *Seven modes. Six personalities. CI/CD. Hall of Fame. The full bakery.*

### Roast-a-thon 🏫
- Roast an entire project directory — every source file gets scored
- Project GPA with letter grades (A+ Dean's List to F- Expelled)
- Valedictorian (best file) and Dropout (worst file) callouts
- Cross-file pattern detection — finds habits that repeat across the codebase
- Caps at 20 files per run with customizable scope (directory, glob, excludes)

### Shareable Roast Cards 📸
- Compact, styled summary card after any roast — designed for Discord, Slack, X, GitHub
- Includes score, worst finding, best praise, and Blunt Cake link
- Max 20 lines — screenshot-ready, no scrolling
- Works for all modes including Batter Battle and Roast-a-thon

### CI/CD GitHub Action 🤖
- Auto-roast PRs with `.github/workflows/blunt-cake-roast.yml`
- Runs Diff Roast on PR changes, posts result as a collapsible PR comment
- Configurable mode and personality via env vars
- Skips diffs over 2000 lines (too large for single pass)
- Requires only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret

### Hall of Fame (& Shame) 🏆
- Community leaderboard in `hall-of-fame/README.md`
- Five boards: Shame (lowest wins), Fame (highest wins), Improvement (best glow-ups), Roast-a-thon Honor Roll, Batter Battle Highlights
- Submit via PR or GitHub Discussions

### Language Packs 🧑‍🍳👵😐🎤🐕🏴‍☠️
- 6 roast personalities: Chef (default), Disappointed Grandma, Passive-Aggressive PR Reviewer, Simon Cowell, Snoop Dogg, Pirate
- Personality selection integrated into the initial mode picker
- Same findings, same fixes, same severity — different delivery voice
- Personality affects roast lines, verdicts, and commentary only. Technical substance never changes.

### Diff Roast 📝
- Roast a git diff instead of a whole file — unstaged, staged, branch, or specific commit
- Reads full file context around changes for accurate assessment
- Scores the DIFF, not the whole file — won't blame pre-existing sins (unless you made them worse)
- Diff-specific roast scale (Clean Spread → Kitchen Fire)
- Per-file breakdown with diff line references (+42, -15/+15)

### Batter Battle 🆚
- Two implementations enter, one leaves — head-to-head comparison
- 5 rounds: Bugs, Security, Performance, Style, Architecture
- Per-round winners with specific reasoning, no ties allowed
- Winner gets roasted for remaining flaws, loser gets actionable steal-list
- After battle, offers Auto-Fix for the losing file

### Auto-Fix Mode 🔧
- After any code roast, offers to apply the fixes
- Three fix scopes: All, Critical/High only, or Pick individual fixes
- Applies edits one at a time, most severe first
- After fixing, offers a re-roast to check your new score
- Won't refactor beyond the finding — fixes exactly what was roasted

## v1.2.0 — 2026-04-05

> *Four modes. Because one way to judge your code was never enough.*

### Eval Mode (Professional Grade)
- Serious code analysis with scored assertions — no jokes until the final verdict
- Generates 8-12 testable assertions per file across 5 categories: Correctness, Security, Reliability, Performance, Maintainability
- Each assertion graded PASS/FAIL with specific evidence (line numbers, code quotes)
- 5 quality dimension scores (1-5) with one-line justifications
- Letter grade (A-F) with pass rate and overall score
- Critical findings get detailed fixes in serious tone
- Final verdict delivered with roast energy — the payoff

### Interactive Mode Selection
- Skill now asks which mode on trigger: Standard 🔥 / Panel 👨‍🍳 / Skill Roast 🎯 / Eval 📊
- Skips the question if user already specified mode in their trigger
- Clear descriptions for each mode so users know what they're getting

### Self-Roast Fixes (from running Skill Roast on ourselves)
- Trigger priority order formalized (Skill → Panel → Standard → Eval)
- Panel agent prompts expanded from one-liners to full specs with severity scales, JSON schemas, and line number requirements
- Edge case handling added (trivially simple code gets a short roast, not manufactured issues)
- Skill Roast output format fully specified (was inheriting code format)
- Rules section moved to top of SKILL.md (behavioral constraints read first)

## v1.1.0 — 2026-04-05

> *One mode wasn't enough. Now there are three.*

### Panel Roast (Multi-Agent)
- 4 specialist agents in parallel — Security Auditor, Performance Analyst, Architecture Critic, Style Judge
- Head Chef coordinator merges, deduplicates, and cross-confirms findings
- Panel Notes table shows which agent found what and where they agreed

### Skill Roast (Meta-Review)
- Review SKILL.md files instead of code — roast the skill design itself
- 8 review categories: Trigger, Instructions, Edge Cases, Output Format, Process, Rules, Creativity, Eval-Readiness
- Separate Skill Roast Scale (Napkin Sketch → Draft → Almost There → Production-Grade)

### Self-Improving Eval Loop
- `self_improve.py` — automated improvement cycle: eval → analyze failures → propose SKILL.md changes → re-eval
- Opus analyzes failed assertions and generates generalized fixes
- SKILL.md backup saved before each modification
- Multi-cycle support: `--cycles 3`, stops early on perfect score

## v1.0.0 — 2026-04-05

> *Your code had it coming.*

### The Skill
- Full code review engine with 6 review categories: Bugs, Security, Performance, Style Crimes, Dead Code, Architecture
- Every finding includes a roast, a real explanation, severity rating, AND a concrete fix
- Roast Scale scoring (0-10): Health Violation → Dumpster Fire → Rare → Medium → Well Done → Chef's Kiss
- Structured output: Verdict, Findings, Scoreboard, Final Words

### The Eval
- 3 hand-crafted test files (security nightmare, decent code, spaghetti monster)
- Automated eval runner with Opus as judge
- 28 assertions across test cases
- First run: 93% pass rate, 5/5 humor, 5/5 actionability
- Self-improved to 100% in 4 iterations
