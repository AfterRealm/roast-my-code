# 🍰 Blunt Cake

A Claude Code agent skill that serves your code review straight — no frosting, no sugarcoating. Every finding is real, every roast is earned, and every issue comes with a fix.

Brutal honesty. Comedic delivery. Actual solutions.

## Install

**Option 1: Via AfterRealm marketplace** (if you have Father Time or other AfterRealm skills)
```bash
claude plugin add afterrealm-plugins/blunt-cake
```

**Option 2: Copy to skills directory** (works for everyone)
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/blunt-cake
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/blunt-cake/SKILL.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AfterRealm/blunt-cake/master/SKILL.md
```

**Option 3: Clone the repo** (includes evals, test files, and GitHub Action)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AfterRealm/blunt-cake.git ~/.claude/skills/blunt-cake
```

After install, run `/skills` in Claude Code to verify it appears, then trigger it with "roast my code" or similar.

## Seven Modes

When triggered, the skill asks which mode you want — plus a personality:

```
🍰 Blunt Cake — Pick your serving:

1. Standard Roast 🔥 — Quick single-pass review
2. Panel Roast 👨‍🍳 — 4 specialist agents in parallel
3. Skill Roast 🎯 — Review a SKILL.md design
4. Eval Mode 📊 — Serious analysis with scored assertions
5. Diff Roast 📝 — Roast a git diff
6. Batter Battle 🆚 — Two files enter, one leaves
7. Roast-a-thon 🏫 — Roast an entire project directory

Pick a personality: 🧑‍🍳 Chef (default) · 👵 Disappointed Grandma · 😐 Passive-Aggressive PR Reviewer · 🎤 Simon Cowell · 🐕 Snoop Dogg · 🏴‍☠️ Pirate
```

### 🔥 Standard Roast
Single-pass review. Fast, funny, thorough. Every finding gets a roast line, a real explanation, and a fix.

### 👨‍🍳 Panel Roast (Multi-Agent)
Spawns 4 specialist agents in parallel:
- **🔓 Security Auditor** — injection, auth gaps, exposed secrets
- **🐌 Performance Analyst** — O(n²), memory leaks, missing indexes
- **🏗️ Architecture Critic** — coupling, god objects, wrong abstractions
- **🤡 Style Judge** — naming crimes, dead code, hidden bugs

A Head Chef coordinator merges findings, deduplicates, and flags cross-confirmed issues (caught by multiple agents independently = high confidence). Panel Notes table shows which agent found what.

### 🎯 Skill Roast (Meta-Review)
Feed it a SKILL.md and it roasts the skill design. 8 review categories: trigger clarity, instruction specificity, edge cases, output format, process flow, rule consistency, unique value, and eval-readiness.

| Score | Rating |
|:---:|---|
| 10 | 🏆 Production-grade — ship it |
| 7-9 | 📦 Almost there — needs polish |
| 4-6 | 📝 Draft — idea is good, spec needs work |
| 1-3 | 🗒️ Napkin sketch — you wrote a wish, not a skill |

### 📊 Eval Mode (Professional Grade)
Serious code analysis. No jokes until the end.

- Generates 8-12 testable assertions per file
- Grades each PASS/FAIL with specific evidence (line numbers, code quotes)
- Scores 5 quality dimensions: Correctness, Security, Reliability, Performance, Maintainability
- Letter grade (A-F) with pass rate and overall score
- Critical findings get detailed fixes
- Final verdict delivered with roast energy

```
📊 CODE EVAL — auth.js

Assertions: 9/12 passed (75%)
Overall: 3.2/5

Grade: C — "You validated the password and forgot everything else.
Like acing the quiz and failing the final."
```

### 📝 Diff Roast (NEW)
Roast your git diff before you commit. Targets only what changed — won't blame you for pre-existing sins (unless you made them worse).

- Reviews unstaged, staged, branch diffs, or specific commits
- Reads full file context around changes for accurate assessment
- Scores the DIFF, not the whole file

```
📝 DIFF ROAST — staged changes

3 files changed, 47 additions, 12 deletions
Score: 6/10 — 🥪 Mid Sandwich

"You fixed the auth bug and introduced two new ones.
That's not a net positive, that's a lateral move."
```

### 🆚 Batter Battle (NEW)
Two implementations enter. One leaves. Side-by-side comparison across all review categories with a declared winner.

- 5 rounds: Bugs, Security, Performance, Style, Architecture
- Per-round winners with specific reasoning
- No ties allowed — someone's getting sent home
- Winner still gets roasted for their flaws
- Loser gets actionable advice stolen from the winner

```
🆚 BATTER BATTLE — auth_v1.js vs auth_v2.js

Round 1 (Bugs): auth_v2 ✓
Round 2 (Security): auth_v2 ✓
Round 3 (Performance): auth_v1 ✓
Round 4 (Style): auth_v2 ✓
Round 5 (Architecture): auth_v2 ✓

🏆 WINNER: auth_v2 (4-1)
"v2 won by a landslide, but that memory leak in round 3
means you're celebrating with a slow clap."
```

## 🧑‍🍳 Language Packs (NEW)

Pick a personality for your roast. Same findings, different delivery:

| Personality | Vibe |
|-------------|------|
| 🧑‍🍳 **Chef** (default) | Celebrity chef who found raw chicken in the walk-in |
| 👵 **Disappointed Grandma** | Not mad, just disappointed. Guilt-trip delivery. |
| 😐 **Passive-Aggressive PR Reviewer** | "Interesting choice 🙂" — corporate hostility in polite wrapping |
| 🎤 **Simon Cowell** | Withering. Dramatic pauses. Grudging "you've got potential." |
| 🐕 **Snoop Dogg** | Chill but devastating. Drops wisdom casually. |
| 🏴‍☠️ **Pirate** | Nautical metaphors. Your secrets are "flying a flag sayin' ROB ME BLIND." |

## 🔧 Auto-Fix (NEW)

After any code roast, Blunt Cake offers to apply the fixes it suggested:

```
🔧 Auto-Fix Available — 7 fixable issues found
- All — Apply all fixes
- Critical/High only — Just the important stuff
- Pick — I'll list them, you choose
- Nah — Just the roast, thanks
```

Fixes are applied one at a time, most severe first. After fixing, offers a re-roast to check your new score.

### 🏫 Roast-a-thon (NEW)
Roast an entire project directory, file by file, and get a project GPA.

- Scans all source files (or a custom glob/directory)
- Caps at 20 files per run — focused, not overwhelming
- Each file gets a score and one-line roast summary
- Identifies the Valedictorian (best file) and the Dropout (worst file)
- Finds project-wide patterns — habits that show up across multiple files
- GPA grading: A+ (Dean's List) to F- (Expelled)

```
🏫 ROAST-A-THON — my-api/

12 files reviewed
GPA: 5.8/10 — Grade: D — Below Average

🎓 Valedictorian: utils/validate.ts (9/10)
📎 Dropout: routes/auth.js (2/10)

Project-wide patterns:
  1. No input validation on 8/12 endpoints
  2. Console.log debugging in 5 files
  3. Zero error handling in database calls
```

## 📸 Shareable Roast Cards (NEW)

After any roast, type "card" to get a compact, styled summary designed for Discord, Slack, X/Twitter, or GitHub comments. Includes your score, worst finding, best praise, and a link back to Blunt Cake. Screenshot-ready.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐

│  🏆 "At least you used bcrypt"       │
│  roasted with 🍰 blunt-cake v2.0    │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🤖 CI/CD — GitHub Action (NEW)

Auto-roast every PR with a GitHub Action. Blunt Cake runs a Diff Roast on the PR changes and posts the result as a comment.

### Quick Setup
1. Copy `.github/workflows/blunt-cake-roast.yml` to your repo
2. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a repository secret
3. Open a PR and watch the roast appear

Configurable via env vars:
- `ROAST_MODE` — `diff` (default), `standard`, or `roast-a-thon`
- `ROAST_PERSONALITY` — any language pack name

The PR comment wraps the roast in a collapsible `<details>` block so it doesn't flood the conversation.

## 🏆 Hall of Fame (& Shame)

Community leaderboard! Submit your roast scores to `hall-of-fame/README.md`:

- **Hall of Shame** — lowest scores win. Wear it with pride.
- **Hall of Fame** — highest scores. Clean code heroes.
- **Hall of Improvement** — best before/after glow-ups.
- **Roast-a-thon Honor Roll** — bravest full-project GPAs.
- **Batter Battle Highlights** — best head-to-head matchups.

Submit via PR or [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions).

## Code Review Categories

| Category | What It Catches |
|----------|----------------|
| 🔥 Bugs | Logic errors, off-by-ones, null derefs, race conditions |
| 🔓 Security | Injection, exposed secrets, missing validation, auth gaps |
| 🐌 Performance | O(n²) disasters, memory leaks, unnecessary work |
| 🤡 Style Crimes | God functions, lying variable names, callback hell |
| 💀 Dead Code | Unreachable branches, TODO archaeology, zombie imports |
| 🏗️ Architecture | Wrong abstractions, circular deps, misplaced logic |

## The Roast Scale (Standard & Panel)

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|:---:|---|---|
| 10 | 👨‍🍳 Chef's Kiss | I came to roast and left humbled |
| 8-9 | 🔥 Well Done | Solid. Minor nitpicks at best |
| 6-7 | 🍳 Medium | Edible but needs seasoning |
| 4-5 | 🥩 Rare | Undercooked. Served too early |
| 2-3 | 🗑️ Dumpster Fire | I've seen better code in a CAPTCHA |
| 0-1 | ☠️ Health Violation | Ship this and someone's going to the hospital |

## Self-Improving Eval Framework

This skill ships with a self-improvement loop for developer QA:

```bash
# Run the eval (9 test cases across all modes)
python evals/run_eval.py --markdown

# Self-improvement cycle (eval → analyze failures → update SKILL.md)
python evals/self_improve.py

# Multi-cycle convergence
python evals/self_improve.py --cycles 3
```

### How It Works
1. Eval runner tests the skill against hand-crafted test files with specific assertions
2. Self-improver reads failures, sends them + SKILL.md to Opus for targeted fixes
3. Opus proposes generalized improvements (not narrow patches)
4. New eval verifies improvement. Repeat until convergence.

### Results
```
Iteration 1: 93% pass rate — initial skill
Iteration 2: 63% — variance, but self-improver found "missing security" gap
Iteration 3: 87% — improvement applied, climbing
Iteration 4: 100% — converged. 5/5 humor, 5/5 actionability.
```

The skill improved itself to a perfect score in 4 iterations.

## Philosophy

1. **Every roast is backed by a real finding.** No fake issues for comedy.
2. **Roast the code, not the coder.** Never attack intelligence or experience.
3. **Always include the fix.** A roast without a solution is just bullying.
4. **Celebrate the good stuff.** The best roasts acknowledge skill before burning the mistakes.
5. **Eval Mode is serious.** Professional assertions with real metrics. Comedy only in the final verdict.
6. **The skill improves itself.** Failed evals drive targeted improvements. Ship, measure, iterate.
7. **Personality is the sauce, not the steak.** Language packs change delivery, never substance.
8. **Fix what you find.** Auto-Fix turns talk into action.
9. **Grade the whole project, not just files.** Roast-a-thon finds patterns individuals miss.
10. **Make it shareable.** If people can't screenshot it, it doesn't spread.
